==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1003-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
The file version of the book was opened and the text was displayed.


==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
head books/other/pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below.

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
less books/other/pg1232.txt (pressing spacebar displayed more of the book text content on the terminal)
more books/other/pg1232.txt (pressing q quits the book and returns back to terminal)

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
you can use head if you want to read from the very beginning. you can use cat if you want a text in its entirety (a short text that won't take over the screen). you can use more if you want to navigate forward and backwards if need be. you can use less to read the file in sections.

wc books/other/pg1232.txt

==========
